New goals/ objectives: "The next step is to make a graphic that explains vQTL results.  First, take a look at our previous Stapleton lab scientific articles
and sketch how we made the graphics. Then find other examples of doing this well (ie not a manhattan plot of P value, but something more informative)."

Went over to Dr. Rhodes lab to look at PCR machine. looked up protocol online and began writing program for DNA
