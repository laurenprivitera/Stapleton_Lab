1/18/18
Met with Stapleton to discuss DIS topic: will be working with Thomas on VQTL
learned about GitHub and made repository

1/23/18
began working through the DataCamp tutorial for R (completed 3/6 tutorials)
Met with Sarah to teach her forensics methods used for data collection in lab: showed her where to find protocols, how to fill PCR tubes, 
and create primer dilutions

1/25/18
finished work on R tutorials and began ones on data visualization 
Finished showing Sarah the forensics methods, showed her how to design a master mix for each primer
began with Thomas on the basics of ggplot

Week of 1/29/18 - 2/2/18
Had the flu so did not make much progress on project 

2/6/18
worked through entire DataCamp tutorial on ggplot
made account on synapse
worked with Sarah and answered questions about PCR
began reading paper on VQTL

2/8/18
helped Sarah with the forensics portion of the project

2/13/18
read the bioRxiv article on vqtl
spoke with Thomas on BioMercator

2/15/18
was not in the lab due to being at a conference in Knoxville, TN

2/20/18
New goals/ objectives: "The next step is to make a graphic that explains vQTL results.  First, take a look at our previous Stapleton lab scientific articles
and sketch how we made the graphics. Then find other examples of doing this well (ie not a manhattan plot of P value, but something more informative)."

Went over to Dr. Rhodes lab to look at PCR machine. looked up protocol online and began writing program for DNA.

2/22/18
continued work with vQTL

3/13/18
read "Loci That Control Nonlinear, Interdependent Responses to Combinations of Drought and Nitrogen Limitation"
	quantitative trait loci
	using single genetic coefficients and a one-SNP-one input relationship, the models partition the phenotypes' variances into additive components that are each determined by a single QTL
	the set of dimensions forms a point in an n-dimensional space, and each point corresponds to an experimental unit such as a plant,row, or plot...together, the set of points that have the same definitions for each dimension comprise a phenotypes
	when a single trait responds to a single stress, it will produce a two-dimensional function lying in a plane, which are valid
	combinations of two or more stresses, or changes in more than one phenotypic dimension, push the phenotypic response function from the plane to surfaces in three or more dimensions, which is complex
	
Notes from Stapleton:
>graphs using vqtl package with one SNP
>take the global mean
>instead of SNP on the row, call it QTL

3/15/18
continued reading paper; asked Thomas questions I had 

3/20/18
was not in the lab due to me being sick; did not make any progress

3/22/18
continued work with vqtl

3/27/18
worked on vQTL and answered questions that Sarah had regarding forensics aspect of the project

3/29/18
was out of town for the Easter holiday

Week of 4/3/18 and 4/5/18
Did not make as much progress as I would have liked due to interviews for jobs post graduation
Made myself available to Sarah on slack to answer questions --> need to ask her for a report on any progress that she has made
